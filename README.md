Cumulous
========

A set of scripts to simplify cloud server management (currently, EC2 servers). 

*list-servers* - Outputs a list of all your EC2 servers
*create-server name* - Created a new server with the given tag name. Returns the hostname.
*kill-server name* - Kills all servers matching the given name.

Be patient. These scripts may take up to twenty or thirty seconds to run sometimes.

Requirements
------------

You will need the EC2 Command Line Tools and a few security key files to get things rolling.
